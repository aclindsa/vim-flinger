2. :StartFlinger Command                                       *:StartFlinger*

        The :StartFlinger command allows you to quickly navigate through a
        list of files in the current |buffer|. This can be useful if you have a
        large list of files which you would like to scan through rapidly.

        When it is called, |:StartFlinger| opens a new buffer containing the
        file at the path at the begininning of the current line in the current
        buffer. The user can then navigate through the list of files or exit
        |flinger| using the default keymappings, or by defining their own (see
        |flinger-settings|).

        Additionally, if the lines in the original buffer contain line numbers
        to the right of the filenames, separated by whitespace from the
        filenames, the cursor is moved to that line number.

    Settings                                                *flinger-settings*

        The following settings allow you to customize the keys which control
        the operation of |flinger| once |:StartFlinger| has been called. These
        should all be set in your |vimrc| file. The examples below contain the
        default mappings for these actions.

        To change the mapping to navigate to the file on the next line in the
        original buffer:
                :let g:flinger_next_file = ",j"

        To change the mapping to navigate to the file on the previous line in
        the original buffer:
                :let g:flinger_previous_file = ",k"

        To change the mapping to exit |flinger| mode and return to the buffer
        which was active when |:StartFlinger| was called:
                :let g:flinger_deactivate = ",f"
